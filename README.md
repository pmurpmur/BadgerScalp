To get this project up and running try the following (granted you have not set up ionic already). If that doesn't work, hit @psmurray up on Slack.

First, install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>

Then run the following in the termainal:

1) sudo npm install -g cordova

2) sudo npm install -g ionic

Then clone this repo to your desktop. 'cd' to the project directory via terminal and then you should be able to run 'ionic serve' in the terminal to run the project in your browser.
